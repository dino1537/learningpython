1. **Error Handling**: Improve error handling to provide more detailed messages
   when something goes wrong, such as when the API is unreachable or returns an
   unexpected response.

2. **Caching**: Implement caching to store API responses temporarily. This can
   reduce the number of API calls and improve performance, especially if the
   same requests are made frequently.

3. **Configuration File**: Use a configuration file to manage API keys and other
   settings. This can make it easier to update the script without changing the
   code.

4. **Interactive Mode**: Add an interactive mode that prompts users for input
   instead of using command-line arguments. This can make the script more
   user-friendly.

5. **Output Formatting**: Offer different output formats, such as JSON, CSV, or
   plain text, which users can choose based on their needs.

6. **Logging**: Add logging to keep track of the script's operations and errors.
   This can be helpful for debugging and monitoring the script's usage.

7. **Unit Tests**: Write unit tests to ensure that each part of the script
   functions correctly. This is important for maintaining code quality,
   especially as the script grows.

8. **Documentation**: Provide thorough documentation, including usage
   instructions, examples, and information about each feature.

9. **Expand Functionality**: Add new features, such as fetching book reviews,
   searching for books by ISBN, or listing all available best sellers lists.

10. **User Preferences**: Allow users to set preferences, such as default
    sections or lists, and save them for future use.

11. **Pagination**: Handle pagination in API responses to allow users to
    navigate through large sets of data.

12. **Rate Limiting**: Respect the API's rate limits by implementing a rate
    limiter or handling 429 (Too Many Requests) status codes gracefully.

13. **Command-Line Help**: Improve the command-line help to provide more
    detailed information about each option and argument.

14. **Internationalization**: Add support for multiple languages, allowing users
    to fetch news and books in their preferred language.

15. **Accessibility**: Ensure that the script's output is accessible,
    considering users who might use screen readers or other assistive
    technologies.
